        <p>Lionfish are native to the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans. They were originally brought to Florida as aquarium fish, but some have been freed by hurricanes. Now, they appear around the lower coast of Florida and other warm ocean habitats. Lionfish have a predatory impact on native species and are harming coastal ecosystems.</p>

        <p>Lionfish are the <em>perfect storm</em>, due to many of the species qualities:</p>
        
        <ol>
        
            <li>They reproduce early in life</li>
            <li>They disperse widely and quickly</li>
            <li>They have venomous spines</li>
            <li>They have few predators</li>
        
        </ol>
        
        <p>There are research efforts underway to better understand the lionfish. Some research questions being addressed include:</p>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>How fast do they grow?</li>
            <li>How many times do they reproduce?</li>
            <li>How many eggs do they produce?</li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <p>Scientists are trying to mitigate the impact of lionfish. They are encouraging <strong>fishery removals</strong> and <strong>human consumption</strong>.</p>
